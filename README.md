# Bank-Marketing-DataSet-Analysis
The Portuguese Bank had run a telemarketing campaign in the past, making sales calls for a term-deposit product. Whether a prospect had bought the product or not is mentioned in the column named 'response'. 

The marketing team wants to launch another campaign, and they want to learn from the past one. You, as an analyst, decide to build a supervised model in R/Python and achieve the following goals:

Reduce the marketing cost by X% and acquire Y% of the prospects (compared to random calling), where X and Y are to be maximized  
Present the financial benefit of this project to the marketing team
